# LandmarkClassification_Tagging
Landmark Classification and Tagging for Social media. This project can be deployed as application.
This project is trained on Landmarks/ Popular destinations across the world. 
The trained model is then used to Identify/Detect the uploaded images downloaded from google and the model should be able to predict what the landmark is and the location of the landmark, which is useful for Social media tagging in case the location data is stripped/ turned off for the image.
There are 2 models deployed.
Model 1(cnn_from_scratch)  : CNN built from scratch.
Model 2(transfer_learning) : Built on learnings from ResNet18 using transfer learning.
